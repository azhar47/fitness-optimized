🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Optimized

This repository is dedicated to applying various website speed optimization techniques to the original Fitness Website project. Changes and improvements will be systematically implemented, tested, and compared against the original version.

📌 About the Project

This project is an optimized version of the original fitness website found at Fitness Repository [https://github.com/azhar47/fitness]. It is being used for educational and research purposes as part of my Master’s thesis on website speed optimization.

The original template is collected from ThemeWagon and has been modified to enhance performance and loading speed.
